Welcome to Failsafe for No-IP!

This project is designed to allow your to maintain any server on no-ip.com for free. There are a few things you need to do before you can run this.

1. Install Python
	The commands module is still needed, so you need a Python that has a 2.7 or 2.6 version.

2a. Download No-IP DUC
	This is a command-line utility that allows you to update and change the IP address of a domain on no-ip.com. Get it here: http://www.no-ip.com/downloads.php

2b. Install No-IP DUC
	Compile it, and move it to /usr/bin/. Make sure you chmod it with +x or 0777.

3. Make sure nmap is installed.
	This can be accomplished on Debian with 'apt-get install nmap'.

4. Ensure cron is running
	You need cron or something similar to make sure this runs every 5 minutes (or whatever you choose).

5. Edit the failsafe.py file
	Find "### IMPORTANT VARIABLES ###" and edit those. It needs your no-ip username, password, site to check, failsafe IP, etc. If you're unsure about giving the password, read the rest of the file to see that it's only used in the No-IP DUC client.

6. Move the failsafe.py file to /usr/bin
	This is optional, but very helpful. You should also rename it to failsafe.

7. Make it executable
	chmod +x /usr/bin/failsafe

8. Test run
	Make sure it's working.

9. Set up a cron job
	To keep it running.
